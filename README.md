### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The liner regression I used to find what variables mattered is as followed:

As shown above, vehicle length and ground clearacne are both non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set. This is because they are both nearly zero. The p-value of this linear regressino is shown at the bottom of the screenshot is 5.35e-11. This is much smaller than .05. So, this is an sitaution where we can reject the null hypothesis. This proves that the slope of the linear model is not zero. The r-squared value of the regession is .7149, so I would say that the model is a good indicator of mpg.
